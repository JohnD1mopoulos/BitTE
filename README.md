# ✈️ BitTE Optimization Project  

**PackApp** 

We are developping an application using Java and various optimization methods to create a packing helper for trips

### Basic Use  
- The user is prompted to input their necessary needs in order to pack their bag
- PackApp finds the most optimal way to fit the items inside the suitcase and outputs the number of items left that can also be packed
