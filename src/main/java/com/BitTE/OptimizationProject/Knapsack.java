/**
 * Represents a dynamic knapsack used to store items, both essential and non-essential.
 
 * The knapsack is designed to operate under specific weight and volume constraints. 
 * If these constraints are not met during the addition of items, the operation 
 * may terminate or fail to add the item depending on if the item is or isn't essential.
 
 * This class can dynamically adjust to accommodate different types of items, 
 * ensuring efficient use of available space and weight capacity.
