9d4bd45 markoulinos 2024-11-25 Refactored TopMen and Clothing class to simplify and clean up code. - Removed redundant getter overrides (getValue, getWeight, getVolume, getSize, getGender)   as they added no additional functionality and relied on inherited behavior. - Simplified the class by retaining only the constructors and a customized toString method. - Ensured adherence to Java style rules for clarity and maintainability. - Focused on leveraging inheritance for inherited methods to reduce code duplication.
